# Anjola-sImageRepo

This is an image repository I built for my shopify application! <br />
This is the MVP, and I plan to include error handling, flash messages, style and refactor my code<br />
Anyone can view the images in the repository, but only signed in users can add images.<br /> 
To access the delete button on the image show page the user must the author of the image.<br />
This application was built using Node.js, Express.js, HTML, MonogoDB.
For authentication I used Passport.js<br />

To run this application locally, clone it. Make sure you have node and monogoDb installed on your system. <br />
To start the application run "node app.js" in your terminal, then connect to localhost:3000 on your web browser
