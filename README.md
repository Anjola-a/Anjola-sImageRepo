"# Anjola-sImageRepo" 
This is an image repository I built for my shopify application!
This is the MVP, and I plan to include error handling, flash messages, style and refactor my code
Anyone can view the images in the repository, but only signed in user can add images. 
To access the delete button on the image show page the user must the author of the image.
This application was built using Node.js, Express.js, HTML, MonogoDB.
For authentication I used Passport
To run this application, clone it. Make sure you have node and monogoDb install on your system. 
To start the application run "node app.js" in your terminal, the connect to localhost:3000 on your web browser
